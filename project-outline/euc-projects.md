Here are a few ideas I have regarding a chapter-sized project I could do with
Rose within the discovery project.

Broadly, I need one, possibly two, chapter-sized projects that I could give
rise to first-author publications. My thesis is due in September 2018, so I
have two years left. My interests are primarily in the landscape genomics parts
of the grant, and the population genomics leading to these analyses. I feel
that we don't have the technical ability to do the phenotyping parts of Project
3 yet, and I'm not willing to take the bullet that will be required to get that
working (that said, Project 3 certainly interests me).

I think that I'd be a fool to continue doing only what I already know how to,
just on a different system. Therefore, I'd like to take on some of the more
novel (at least to me) technical parts, especially with regards to landscape
genomics. Particularly I need to be stronger in the more mathematical and
statistical aspects of these analyses.


# *E. moluccana*, *E. albens*, *E. microcarpa* project

This entails examining the population structure of the MOL/ALB/MIC complex, and
possible further landscape genomics analysis of this complex.

## Gene-tree Concordance Analysis

I'm quite interested in the idea of creating windowed "gene"-trees across
*Adnataria*. I'm interested in how we can intelligently define windows to
maximise the power of this analysis.


# Possible experiments using the full dataset

## Quantification of "species"

A recent paper on speciation proposes a framework that uses Approximate
Bayesian Computation to look quantitatively at speciation through levels of
divergence observed between populations and species. They find novel cryptic
species.

Along the same lines, I'd like to look at molecular divergence ($\pi$) of
windows across the genome, examining the within-site, within-species and
inter-species patterns of diversity.

## Neutral processes in *Eucalyptus* evolution/diversification

Look for "selection" in places known to be non-adaptive.
