- see if hybrid check can take vcf (prob via dna bin via https://knausb.github.io/vcfR_documentation/dnabin.html)
- See if rose did -doThetas to find global estimate of 4N. Perhaps check myberg
  grandis ref paper for easy answer.

- is it worth doing ABBABABA analysis at level between sample & spp, perhaps based off mash or ngsDist

- redo mpileup vcf with merged data
- filter bcf to create vcf for jaz for hybrid check (coverage, individuals, 0.05
  MAF)
